# Overview

This repository contains a set of Python tools to assist with the migration from the FOLIO OKAPI platform to the FOLIO Eureka platform. Many of the scripts need to be run in the order presented below as they build upon each other. I purposely did not combine them into a single function to allow for the review of data at each step.

# Installation

Copy .env.example over to .env and populate with your local settings.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install \-r requirements.txt
```

# Setup
Before this script can be installed and ran remotely the data sets need be generated.
